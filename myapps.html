    <p> our very first project was a simple game on scratch, for mine I thought the dinosaurs were cute and based my game on that </p>

    <h3> 4 Screen App </h3>

    <p> our second project was a simple app that had to have four different screens, for mine I made an app that would display different songs for different moods </p>
    <hr/>
    <h3> Music Generator </h3>
    <iframe width="400" height="620" style="border: 0px;" src="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/hCMptnuqjQmZ_hnyKlnvgaNJ13soddio5sL0T6W5puE/embed"></iframe>
    <p> for this app we had to build something based on the input or conditions that were selected by the user, I made another music one that would present a song based on you age and preferred music genre </p>
    <hr/>
    <h3> Digital Design </h3>
    <iframe width="400" height="620" style="border: 0px;" src="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/DkddCK381POBM6fZ8URUCpsNIp6Q831Z0WpxcijIsA0/embed"></iframe>
    <p> my next app was a group project, we all created different elements and put it together to create a unique space scene each time the app was reset </p>
    <hr/>
    <h3> Dataset/ AP project </h3>
    <iframe width="400" height="620" style="border: 0px;" src="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/8zM3q_NgLaPM1EdZWkpY9kgBq2749hYtTdVfp2EfEHg/embed"></iframe>
    <p> our most recent app was a data set app that I also chose to use as my AP project, it is based off a data table from code.org. this app helps you chose a Netflix movie based on oldest and newest, genre, and the country it was produced in </p>
